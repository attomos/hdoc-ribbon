# hdoc-ribbon (100-days-of-code-ribbon)

`hdoc-ribbon` is a custom HTML element I worked on as part of my #100DaysOfCode journey to learn
new stuffs and re-learn many things

## Usage

Include this script in your HTML
```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/hdoc-ribbon@1.0.0/index.js"></script>
```

And start using it in your document:

```html
<!-- put the ribbon on the top right corner -->
<hdoc-ribbon
  data-day="11"
  position="right"
  href="https://github.com/attomos/100-days-of-code"
></hdoc-ribbon>

<!-- put the ribbon on the top left corner -->
<hdoc-ribbon
  data-day="100"
  position="left"
  href="https://github.com/attomos/100-days-of-code"
></hdoc-ribbon>
```
